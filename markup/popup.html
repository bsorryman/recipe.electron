        <p class="content_txt">
          Pat chicken dry with paper towels, season all over with 2 tsp. salt, and tie legs together
          with kitchen twine. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour.
          Meanwhile, halve squash and scoop out seeds. Run a vegetable peeler along ridges of squash halves to remove
          skin. Cut each half into 쩍"-thick wedges; arrange on a rimmed baking sheet.
          Combine sage, rosemary, and 6 Tbsp. melted butter in a large bowl; pour half of mixture over squash on baking
          sheet. Sprinkle squash with allspice, red pepper flakes, and 쩍 tsp. salt and season with black pepper; toss to
          coat.
          Add bread, apples, oil, and 쩌 tsp. salt to remaining herb butter in bowl; season with black pepper and toss to
          combine. Set aside.
          Place onion and vinegar in a small bowl; season with salt and toss to coat. Let sit, tossing occasionally,
          until
          ready to serve.
          Place a rack in middle and lower third of oven; preheat to 425째F. Mix miso and 3 Tbsp. room-temperature butter
          in a small bowl until smooth. Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then rub or brush all over with miso butter.
          Place chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and roast on middle rack until an instant-read thermometer inserted
          into the thickest part of breast registers 155째F, 50??0 minutes. (Temperature will climb to 165째F while
          chicken
          rests.) Let chicken rest in skillet at least 5 minutes, then transfer to a plate; reserve skillet.
          Meanwhile, roast squash on lower rack until mostly tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and scatter
          reserved bread mixture over, spreading into as even a layer as you can manage. Return to oven and roast until
          bread is golden brown and crisp and apples are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, drain pickled
          onions,
          and toss to combine. Transfer to a serving dish.
          Using your fingers, mash flour and butter in a small bowl to combine.
          Set reserved skillet with chicken drippings over medium heat. You should have about 쩌 cup, but a little over
          or
          under is all good. (If you have significantly more, drain off and set excess aside.) Add wine and cook,
          stirring
          often and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until bits are loosened and wine is reduced by
          about
          half (you should be able to smell the wine), about 2 minutes. Add butter mixture; cook, stirring often, until
          a
          smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes. Add broth and any reserved drippings and cook, stirring constantly, until
          combined and thickened, 6?? minutes. Remove from heat and stir in miso. Taste and season with salt and black
          pepper.
          Serve chicken with gravy and squash panzanella alongside.
